description: "The Peony Pavilion (Chinese: 牡丹亭; pinyin: Mǔdān tíng; Wade–Giles: Mu-tan\
  \ t'ing), also named The Return of Soul at the Peony Pavilion, is a romantic tragicomedy\
  \ play written by dramatist Tang Xianzu in 1598, and the plot was drawn from the\
  \ short story Du Liniang Revives For Love. It depictes a love story between Du Liniang\
  \ and Liu Mengmei, overcomes all difficulties, transcending time and space, life\
  \ and death, and finally get together. Different from the short story, in Tang'\
  \ s play, it is a dynamic integration of the legendary and the reality in Ming Dynasty.\
  \ Scenes of love in dreams, Du Liniang's revival, or any supernatural element seem\
  \ absurd in play, but it reflects the sprout of humanism, through protagonists'\
  \ strong desire and unremitting pursuit of free love, and uncovers the degeneracy\
  \ of the society under feudalism at that time.\nThe play was originally written\
  \ for staging as Kunqu opera, one of genres of traditional Chinese theatre arts,\
  \ and first performed in 1598 at the Pavilion of Prince Teng. With its sophisticated\
  \ plot, magnificent dramatic structure and well-depicted characters, The Peony Pavilion\
  \ has become the most popular play of the Ming dynasty, especially the well-depicted\
  \ character, Du Liniang, which became one of the female representative in ancient\
  \ Chinese drama. Most audience and contemporary critics made a high estimation on\
  \ the play. It has become one of the most classics in traditional Chinese theatre\
  \ art, and Kun theatre troupes can not consider their repertoire complete without\
  \ this play.\nTang Xianzu was one of the greatest dramatists and writers in Ming\
  \ Dynasty, and The Peony Pavilion can be regarded as his most successful masterpiece\
  \ in his life. It is also one of drama in Tang's famous collection Linchuan is meng\
  \ (The Four Dreams in the Jade Tea Hall), the other three plays are Zichai Ji (The\
  \ Purple Hairpin), Nanke Ji (A Dream Under the Southern Bough) and Handan Ji (The\
  \ Handan Dream). Both the play and its dramatist get a high reputation on Chinese\
  \ and international stages, and the study on Tang Xianzu has become a popular subject\
  \ today.\nThe play has a total of 55 scenes, which can run for more than 22 hours\
  \ onstage.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
